# SX4U
SX4U or Script eXtract for Unity decompiles a game made by the Unity 3D game engine and gives you the source code by which the game was made in.

Unity supports

C#
UnityScript (Javascript)
Boo
When compiling the game, Unity converts all the scripts to C# code. This means all the UnityScript and Boo scripts are converted to C# code. So SX4U gives you the C# code of the UnityScripts and Boo scripts.

To select all text: Ctrl + A

To copy text: Ctrl + C

To hide search box: Esc

Local variables are kept at the bottom of their respective functions for easy analyzing so if you try to directly copy and compile the extracted code make sure to remove those variables.
